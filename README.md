# File Organizer

A simple file organizer written in Python3.

Organizes files in the specified directory (and its subdirectories) according to their extensions. 

## How to run
First we need to install the `watchdog module`. Run the following command in the terminal

`pip install watchdog`

## Usage
`python3 main.py <directory path>`

## Contribution

The list of file extensions is not complete. There are hundreds of other file extrensions that I am not aware of. I just included the ones that I know of and I use regularly. 

Feel free to update the file extensions list to your knowledge and purpose
